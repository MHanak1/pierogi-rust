# pierogi-rust
A **work in progress** rewrite of my previous Pierogi implementation in rust.

## What is pierogi?
well it is a joke "virus" software which is a pieróg hopping around the screen like a dvd logo and going other semi malicious things

## is it dangerous
kinda. in releases i will only provide the "safe version" which does not persist over system logout/restart and have a instance limit

if you are willing to build the app yourself you can modify the code to disable those safeguards however **you do this at your own risk, i am not responsible for any damage caused**.

## How to run?
simply download the executable file suitable for your os and run it. **only run it on your own devices**

i will not provide instructions on how to compile this, since if you don't know how to do it maybe the safeguarded version will be enough.
